Algorithm for Stochastic RSI :

1. Get the details of the previous record.
	This includes:
	- Previous record's [Price,upEWM (EWM=Exponential Weighed Moving Average),downEWM,RSI values for the past 13 days(14th value is going to be current value),Stochastic RSI values for the past 2 days(3rd value is going to be the current value), FastK values for the past 2 days(3rd value is going to be the current value)]
2. Calculate current Stochastic RSI.
	- Calculate the following:
		-change,up,down,rs,rsi,Stochastic RSI(requires the latest 14 RSI values(including the current period)) ,FastK(requires the latest 3 Stochastic RSI values) ,FastD(requires the latest 3 FastK values).
3. We now save the data calculated for this period in order to calculate the indicators for the next period.
	We save the following details for the next period:
	- current close price
	- current upEWM 
	- current downEWM
	- RSI for the latest 13 periods(current RSI along with the past 12 periods' RSI)
	- Stochastic RSI for the latest 2 periods(current Stochastic RSI along with the last 1 period RSI)
	- FastK for the latest 2 periods(current FastK along with the last 1 period FastK)

Note: In this approach, we are never calculating record for the 1st period. This is because for every stock, the initial record will be pre-calculated and stored in the database by us. Its a manual task but the best possible approach. Will take about an hour or so for you to put the initial records in the Dynamo DB.
